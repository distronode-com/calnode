// Constraint violations are the one class of database error Calnode routinely acts
// on rather than just reporting: a duplicate slug is a 409, an out-of-range value is
// a 400, a dangling reference is a 404. Deciding which is which used to be a
// substring match on SQLite's English message, which is invisible to every gate and
// degraded silently to a 500 on PostgreSQL.
//
// Both engines are matched on their error codes. Codes rather than text because the
// text is not a contract: PostgreSQL localises its messages by the server's
// lc_messages, so a server running in German defeats any text match no matter how

// collisions, and Calnode has one that matters: idempotency_keys.idempotency_key is
// a bare PRIMARY KEY, so every idempotent replay arrives as 1555. Both belong to

// 23505 like any other unique violation — which is why the trap only exists on one

// A driver error is a DEFINITE answer in both directions. A *pgconn.PgError or a
// *sqlite.Error whose code does not match returns false and does not fall through to
// the text comparison — falling through would classify an error by whether its
// message happened to contain an English phrase, which is the fragility being
// removed. It would also reintroduce the primary-key trap in reverse: a 1555 error
// excluded by code would be readmitted by its "UNIQUE constraint failed" message.
//
// The text fallback is deliberate rather than vestigial. It covers an error that
// reaches here without the concrete driver type still attached — a driver release
// that changes its error type, a layer that reformats an error into a plain one
// instead of wrapping it. In that case the message is the only signal left, and
// answering from it beats answering "not a constraint violation" and returning a 500.
