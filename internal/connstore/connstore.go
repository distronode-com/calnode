// Package connstore holds the pieces of the calendar_connections upsert logic that
// are genuinely identical across every provider (Google, Microsoft, CalDAV) — the
// "-1 means any" filter convention, and the destination-claiming business rule. Each
// provider's row shape and OAuth/credential handling stay separate: Google/Microsoft
// store two OAuth tokens, CalDAV stores a username/password; Microsoft additionally
// tracks account_kind. Forcing those into one generic type would obscure more than it
// shares, so this package deliberately stays small.

// DestinationCalendarID returns the sub-calendar within one connected account that the

//
// Why this is separate from calendar_connections.is_destination: those are two different
// questions. The connections row answers "which connected ACCOUNT do bookings go to";
// this answers "which calendar INSIDE that account". A Google account exposes many
// calendars and only ever writes to the account row's calendar_id, which is "primary" -
// so without this, a user who picks their work calendar gets conflict checking against it
// (conflicts.go already honours the selection) while bookings still land in their personal
// primary. That mismatch is what discussion #10 reported.
//
// ok=false means the account has no explicit sub-calendar choice, and the caller must keep
// the account-level calendar_id. That is the upgrade path: every existing install has rows
// seeded from calendar_connections with is_destination copied across, so behaviour is
// unchanged until someone actively picks a different calendar.
