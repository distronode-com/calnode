// TestPoll_purgesOldFinishedDeliveries covers a table that nothing ever swept.

// SQLite file Litestream replicates offsite. Five other tables are already purged by
// this same job; this one was simply missed.
//
// The retention rule is deliberately narrow, and the pending case below is why: a
// pending delivery still has a jobs row referring to it by id, so deleting one would
// convert a deliverable webhook into a permanent failure. Only rows that reached a
// terminal status, and therefore have already been attempted, may be swept.
